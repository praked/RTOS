## VOIP Phone Assignment

A simple VOIP application is created in this assignment. There are two applications, client and server. Server sets up a sound server on the computer and plays any sound that is sent to it. The client program connects to any such server and sends the sound picked up by it. If computer A and B want to call each other, both have to run client and server application and should connect to each other. The client sends a packet every predetermined number of miliseconds which can be configured in the software. The test was successful, however the volume seemed rather less, probably because I was recording audio through virtual box.
